this is first project
submit the data to database

== remove from the local git repository if you dont want to push that to github repository
git rm --cached file_Name
== it will be removed from the local git and it will be untracked in working directory

- later I have added that file into .gitignore file, so by default git will ignore those files which are in .gitignore file and push other files to git local repository
